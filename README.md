Description

Creomine is a building, creation, and technology centered game with some mystical tweaks and alien chemistrys to mix it up a bit â€” more like a lot. The creomine world's exotic features are mostly centered around the 126th element on the periodic table, Celeronium and its crystaline metalic polymer materials MESE and ESEM and their many variants, aswhell as the 164th element, Guptonium and its high energies. The game contains lots and lots of building blocks with great mods like moreblocks moreores technic xdefault esemics mesecons unifieddyes stained_glass and unified_inventory plus a whole bunch more. Get creative and make something cool! Have fun!
