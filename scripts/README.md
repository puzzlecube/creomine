Minetest Game Updator

A tool to streamline the development of subgames that are backwards compatible with a base game, like Creomine being backwards compatible to Minetest Game. Currently only contains a bash version but if you can port it to more languages please do so and send a pull request. It is intended to be useful for subgame deve, server devs, and just the regular user who wants a customized game to play on.

Default configuration is targeting my Creomine subgame and minetest game but is configurable in the file gameupdate.conf so it is tweakable for many other subgames.

Have fun!
